			Blarney Castle is a medieval 
			stronghold in Blarney, near Cork, Ireland. 
			Though earlier fortifications were built on the 
			same spot, the current keep was built by the 
			MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty, a cadet branch 
			of the Kings of Desmond, and dates from 1446. 
			The Blarney Stone is among the machicolations of 
			the castle.

				The castle is now a partial ruin with some 
				accessible rooms and battlements. At the 
				top of the castle lies the Stone of 
				Eloquence, better known as the Blarney 
				Stone. Tourists visiting Blarney Castle 
				may hang upside-down over a sheer drop to 
				kiss the stone, which is said to give the 
				gift of eloquence. There are many 
				versions of the origin of the stone, 
				including a claim that it was the Lia 
				Fáil — a numinous stone upon which Irish 
				kings were crowned.
