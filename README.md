# Online Garage Sale
###### By: Thomas Walsh, Neha Patel, and Evan Konermann
## Purpose
OGS is similar to an online garage sale where users can upload items they are selling and can purchase items others are selling. On the home page we will have a “featured sellers” section that constantly updates the top sellers as well as a “Search the Pile” section where users are randomly shown random items recently uploaded. With this website, we want to create a platform where users can easily sell and buy used items. We are using HTML and CSS to properly implement this.

## Week 10
In order to run Week 10 you must install the "live server" extension for VS Code. Select the repository and click go live. Then open the XML file in the Week 10 folder.
